# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. 
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, 
# and the '|' on the right marks the last column you can put character.  
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  
# It's also customary to leave one space after the ':', before words.
# Note that there is no space in line 9 and 11.
