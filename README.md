### NightSky's slackpkg

Here are slackbuild scripts for slackware -14.1, -14.2, and even -current.

Some packages require specific version, which I provided.

For the others, you should download source file before you execute scripts.

---
Before using, you need to execute the following command:

    # echo '[0-9]+_ny' >> /etc/slackpkg/blacklist

so that it will ignore custom packages when executing slackpkg update/upgrade


> Note: 
> Since -current is always be latest, consider calfully before you use.
> All scripts require to be executed as root, to use command '/sbin/makepkg'
